Finds the variance for the noise variance of each salinity measurement by comparing it
to the noise_variance of all the other measurements. Can be thought of as the average
difference between measured salinity and expected salinity:

noise_variance = (sum({x - y}^2)) / 2*N where
x is the current observation
y is the closest observation (spatially)
N is the number of elements

This is because we assume that the noise variance is uncorrelated over distance, that it has
uniform variance, and that the signal has a longer correlation distance than the
data separation (WJO 2003, Delayed-Mode Calibration of Autonomous CTD Profiling
Float Salinity Data by Î¸S Climatology).
